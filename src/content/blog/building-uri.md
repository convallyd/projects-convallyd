Technical audiences don't want you to make things "better." They want you to solve fundamental problems.

I learned this at Microsoft, working on TechNet and MSDN — massive documentation sites serving IT Pros and developers. These sites were incredibly hard to navigate, but the audiences had built strategies to deal with the complexity. When you changed something, you didn't simplify their lives — you broke their strategies. The bar was impossibly high: solve a real problem or you're just piling on pain.

When I moved to Windows Server, I found a different problem. Some engineering teams had been burned by UX research and flat-out refused to work with researchers. Enterprise platforms are difficult for technical people — they can be completely alienating for non-technical social scientists showing up to "help." My approach was always the same: figure out what the team actually needs, deliver quick value, build trust, and only then start advising on richer research methods.

But there was a structural problem I couldn't solve from inside Microsoft. User Research was a separate team. We were loaned out to product groups. When a V1 product shipped and everyone who contributed got elevated through the product org, I got returned to the researcher pool for the next assignment. Embedded enough to make a real impact, never part of the team that benefited from it.

I was an internal vendor. And that was the problem.

## The Leap

My co-founder Justin Lowe saw the same thing. We're both British expats who joined Microsoft around the same time and arrived at the same conclusion: we were already operating as internal vendors. Making that external wasn't a massive leap — but it meant we could drive our own work and our own rewards.

Justin started about 18 months before me, picking up a few projects. When I left Microsoft, I won one large project that paid well enough to carry me through several quiet months before the next one arrived. From there the work piled on, but Justin and I were still operating independently. I proposed we work like an actual business — triaging work between us, sharing everything 50:50 like real partners. That was the moment URI became URI. We pooled resources, made our first hires, and rented our first office near Microsoft, our biggest client.

## The Moment It Clicked

Our first whale was Microsoft.com — the third most visited website in the world at the time. The site had changed a lot since my time there, but it had enormous needs around search, design systems, and information architecture. We started with rapid iterative testing, but as designs matured, teams wanted large-sample quantitative data for confidence in their choices.

My experience with unmoderated online testing platforms let me design something new: a comparative test of four different design systems, grounded in real scenarios so the feedback wasn't opinion — it was measured as task success and time on task. The data was so compelling that teams applauded the research presentation. We became the de facto UX research vendor for MSCOM.

That was the inflection point. But growth didn't come from repeating what worked — it came from building programs, not just projects. As online platforms like UserTesting put basic tools directly into designers' hands, the quick-turnaround testing that launched us started to commoditize. We survived by going where complexity lived: Microsoft SQL, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform. Spaces where you needed real technical depth to even understand the users.

## Solve Your Own Problems, Then Sell the Solution

One philosophy drove everything: if we had a problem, we built the solution — then offered it to clients. We built our own research panel so we didn't have to rely on vendors. We built our own labs. We built a team of cloud engineers to support technical research. Each started as an internal need and became a competitive advantage.

When the pandemic hit, this philosophy faced its biggest test. We were a user testing company that needed to meet humans — especially for hardware testing. We had ten research labs suddenly out of commission. Companies approached us about testing in New Zealand because they had zero COVID cases.

That was the industry's answer. Go remote. But you can't test a physical device remotely. You need a human in a room with hardware in their hands. Every company with a usability lab or hardware testing program hit the same wall, and the industry had no playbook for in-person research under pandemic conditions.

I decided there was a problem without a real solution, so I designed one: [contactless labs](/projects/contactless-labs). Clean rooms with HEPA-filtered air exchanging the full volume multiple times per hour. UVC light blasts between participants. Full spray-down protocols protecting researcher, participant, and facilitator.

While others waited for the pandemic to end, we grew our client base. Companies that couldn't run studies anywhere else came to us.

## Building a Product Changed How I See Products

[Panel Pro](/projects/panel-pro) was probably our biggest bet — an enterprise platform for self-serve research participant recruiting, built from scratch with a very small team. Building it required me to learn pricing, competitive positioning, marketing, SaaS product strategy — the list kept growing.

It gave me something I didn't expect: a completely different respect for product teams. So much of what you see in a finished product doesn't communicate the time and thought behind each feature and design choice. After 15 years of evaluating other people's products, building one myself changed how I saw the work.

## The Transition

The last two years at URI took me away from where I do my best work. I'm a strategic problem solver at a company-wide level, and I found myself fighting for resources for a product facing internal resistance. I didn't feel as connected to the clients, teams, and platforms I'd supported for over 15 years.

At the same time, I watched a new epoch arrive — AI and automation hitting everything I'd spent my career studying. I wanted to be part of it. Not advising from the outside. Building.

In January 2025, I transitioned to a board role and stepped into what comes next.

## What 17 Years Taught Me

You need to believe in what you're doing and in the people you're doing it with. If you don't wake up every morning motivated by the work, the team, and the opportunities ahead of you, you won't achieve your potential.

Since leaving URI, I've been more excited about waking up and working hard every day than I have in some time. There are no guarantees that what I do will be rewarded. But I'm doing work I believe is needed and necessary — and not doing it has never been an option for me.
