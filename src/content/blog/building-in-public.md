Most of my career happened behind NDAs. Research for Azure before it launched. Google Cloud Platform benchmarks. AR/VR methodologies for Meta's Quest. The work mattered, but it disappeared into corporate walls the moment it was delivered.

That's fine when you're an agency. Less fine when you're trying to figure out what comes next.

## Why Open

I left URI in January 2025 and started building — AI agents, automation workflows, open-source tools. The difference from agency work hit me immediately: when you share the process, you learn different things. People push back on your assumptions. They point you to tools you hadn't considered. The feedback loop is faster and more honest than any stakeholder review.

So that's the approach now. Share what I'm building, how I'm building it, and what breaks along the way.

## What This Actually Looks Like

I'm documenting the decisions, not just the outcomes. Which tools I picked and why. Where I hit dead ends. What surprised me. The messy middle of trying to build useful things with AI — not the polished case study after the fact.

## The Overlap I Keep Coming Back To

I spent 17 years studying how people adopt complex enterprise platforms. AI agents are the next version of that problem — except now the "user" and the "system" are negotiating in real time. The research instincts are the same. The medium is completely different.
