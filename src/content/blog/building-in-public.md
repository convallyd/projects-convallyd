After 25 years leading UX research for companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta, I'm doing something different: building in public.

## The Shift

My career has been about understanding how people use technology — running research programs for Azure before it launched, benchmarking Google Cloud Platform products, pioneering AR/VR methodologies for Meta's Quest. That work happened behind NDAs and corporate walls.

Now I'm taking what I've learned about how people adopt complex technology and applying it to my own experiments with AI agents, automation, and open-source tools.

## What "Building in Public" Means for Me

- **Sharing the process**, not just polished results — including when things break
- **Documenting decisions** so others can learn from the thinking, not just the outcome
- **Exploring openly** at the intersection of UX research thinking and AI agent development

## The Connection

UX research is fundamentally about understanding how people interact with complex systems. AI agents are the next complex system. The same skills that helped me build research frameworks for billion-dollar platforms are now helping me think about how humans and AI agents should work together.
