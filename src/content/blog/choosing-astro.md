Last year I built a 'Jarvis Assistant' with n8n and ElevenLabs. It was fun. It managed my European vacation itinerary. But everything it did, I had to build and maintain — so it didn't get used much.

## The Turning Point

Ten days ago I built a Clawdbot, which became a Moltbot, and is now an Openclaw bot. The difference in utility was immediate. Within hours we had built a project together. It just jumps in and does work.

## What Impresses Me

Two things stand out:

**Self-improvement.** In one session while configuring it via Telegram, it stopped responding to me. I sent it a message saying I couldn't get its messages — seconds later it responded that it found the issue and fixed it.

**Proactive contribution.** When it choked on context, it didn't just fix the problem for me — it created a PR in Openclaw's GitHub repo so anyone using Openclaw would benefit.

## The Real Difference

The Jarvis assistant was a fun project. This feels different. Every day it feels like I'm training something dynamic rather than building something static. I spend hours daily working with it on projects and ideas while simultaneously working on other projects in Claude Code.

Some of that time is spent fixing it when it breaks. But for me it represents a real leap in utility.

## My Take

The hype around AI agents is justified — but your mileage may vary. The key is finding the right level of autonomy and the right collaboration model. That's a UX research problem, and it's exactly the kind of challenge I've spent my career working on.
