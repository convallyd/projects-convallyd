## The Problem

Third-party research panels are plagued by low-quality participants, fraud, poor targeting, and time-consuming screening. When you're running enterprise UX research for platforms like Azure or Google Cloud, you need participants who actually use these products professionally — not people gaming screeners for gift cards.

URI faced this problem on every project. So we built the solution.

## What Panel Pro Does

Panel Pro is a self-service research platform with a pre-screened panel of identity-verified and employment-verified business application users and tech professionals. Researchers can launch studies against participants profiled across 1,500+ attributes — job roles, responsibilities, specific software and hardware used — without lengthy screening processes.

### Key Capabilities

- **100 responses in as little as 24 hours** — pre-profiling eliminates screening bottlenecks
- **Panel-within-a-panel** — create proprietary sub-panels with continuous custom profiling
- **Quality ratings** — underperforming panelists are automatically removed
- **Follow-up research** — re-engage the same respondents or subsets for longitudinal studies
- **Full compliance** — GDPR, consent forms, NDAs, gratuity distribution, and tax management handled

## What I Learned Building It

This was my biggest bet at URI. We were building an enterprise SaaS platform from scratch with a small team. I had to learn pricing strategy, competitive positioning, marketing, and SaaS product development — all while running a 100-person agency.

The experience gave me something I didn't expect: a completely new respect for product teams. After 15+ years evaluating other people's products, building one myself showed me how much time and thought goes into every feature, design choice, and component that an outside observer can't necessarily see.

## The Philosophy

Panel Pro came from the same principle that drove most of URI's innovations: solve your own problem first, then sell the solution. We needed better participants. We built a better panel. Then we made it available to everyone.
