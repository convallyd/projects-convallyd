## The Journey

Started with a 'Jarvis Assistant' built using n8n and ElevenLabs — a voice-activated agent that managed vacation itineraries and ran custom workflows. Fun to build, but everything required manual setup and maintenance.

### The Leap

Transitioned to building autonomous coding agents — starting with a Clawdbot, evolving through Moltbot, and landing on Openclaw. The difference in utility was immediate: within hours of setup, the agent was building projects collaboratively.

### What Makes It Different

- **Self-improving** — The agent continuously fixes and improves itself during sessions
- **Proactive** — Identifies issues and creates PRs in open-source repos without being asked
- **Collaborative** — Works alongside Claude Code on parallel tasks
- **Dynamic** — Feels like training something that grows rather than building something static

### Current Focus

Exploring the frontier of what AI agents can do autonomously — from context management to multi-agent collaboration.
