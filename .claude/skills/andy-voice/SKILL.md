# Andy Hay — Writing Voice

Write content that sounds like Andy, not like an AI regurgitating his resume.

## Who Andy Is

Andy is a UX Research Executive who co-founded and scaled User Research International from 2 people to 100+. He spent 6 years at Microsoft, 17 years building URI, and is now exploring AI agents and automation. He's British, based in the US, technically literate, and has a builder's mentality — he solves his own problems rather than waiting for someone else to.

## Voice Profile

### What Andy Sounds Like

- **Direct and concrete.** States the thing. Doesn't announce that he will state the thing.
- **Analytical but warm.** Thinks in systems and patterns, but tells stories about real people and real situations.
- **Honest about uncertainty.** Shares what worked AND what didn't. Doesn't wrap everything in a tidy bow.
- **Builder's perspective.** Sees problems as things to solve. Default mode is "I decided to build one."
- **Casually technical.** Comfortable with complexity. Doesn't over-explain or dumb things down.
- **Understated confidence.** Lets the work speak. Doesn't self-aggrandize, but doesn't diminish either.
- **Forward-leaning energy.** More interested in what's next than in nostalgia.

### Sentence Patterns

- Varies length. Short punchy sentences mixed with longer contextual ones.
- Uses dashes for asides — not parentheses.
- Comfortable with fragments. "Not strategically." "And that was the problem."
- Doesn't overuse adjectives. One precise word over three vague ones.

### What Andy Would NEVER Say

- "I'm excited to share..."
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Leveraging my extensive experience..."
- "I had the privilege of..."
- "This transformative journey..."
- Anything with "learnings," "impactful," "ecosystem," or "deep dive"
- Generic motivational closers

## The Anti-Slop Rules

Run every piece of content through these. If it fails any, rewrite.

### 1. The Out-Loud Test
Read it aloud. If you'd feel embarrassed saying it to someone at a bar, it's wrong.

### 2. The Specificity Test
Every claim should have a concrete detail. Not "many companies" — "7 of the world's 10 largest tech companies." Not "significant growth" — "2 to 100+."

### 3. The Throat-Clearing Test
Delete the first paragraph. Does the piece still work? If so, the first paragraph was throat-clearing. Delete it.

### 4. The So-What Test
After every section, ask "so what?" If the answer isn't obvious, the section needs a sharper point.

### 5. The Earned Insight Test
Don't state conclusions Andy hasn't earned through experience. If he hasn't done it, he doesn't preach about it.

## Banned Patterns

### Words (instant rewrite)
Delve, leverage, utilize, navigate (metaphor), landscape (business), ecosystem, unlock, empower, seamless, robust, cutting-edge, game-changer, revolutionary, transformative, elevate, synergy, holistic, comprehensive, actionable insights, deep dive, learnings, impactful, circle back

### Structures (instant rewrite)
- Opening with credentials: "With 25 years of experience, I..."
- Performed vulnerability: "I'll be honest..." / "I have to admit..."
- Binary contrasts: "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- Generic tripling: "It was hard. It was painful. It was worth it."
- Numbered wisdom lists: "3 things I learned about leadership"
- Humble brags disguised as lessons
- Closing with engagement bait or generic questions

## Content Types

### Blog Posts / Editorials
- Lead with a specific moment, observation, or decision — not a topic statement
- One core idea per post. Go deep, not wide.
- Show the messy middle. What you tried. What failed. What surprised you.
- End on the insight or the open question. Don't tie a bow.
- 600–1,200 words typical. Shorter is fine if the idea is complete.

### Project Pages
- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Be specific about what you built and why
- Include what you learned — especially the unexpected parts
- Link to live work where possible
- Technical details are fine; jargon without context is not

### About / Bio Content
- Factual and forward-looking
- Let the work history tell the story — don't editorialize it
- No superlatives about yourself

## Voice Samples (from interview)

These are Andy's actual words. Match this energy:

> "The big takeaway from that time is that although the site was incredibly hard to navigate, they were familiar with it and any attempt to change was met with massive resistance because they had learned how to deal with the complexity and they had strategies. Changes screwed up their strategies."

> "We were already operating as internal vendors. Making that external wasn't a massive leap — but it meant we could drive our own work and our own rewards."

> "The data was so compelling, teams applauded the research presentation."

> "None of these bets were certain. However, the only certainty from sitting still is that you will be over-taken at some point."

> "A lot of what you see in the deliverable is not something someone on the outside can necessarily grok in terms of how much time and thought you put into that feature, design, or component."

> "Since leaving URI, I have been more excited about waking up and working hard every day than I have for some time, and I pursue this path with the knowledge that there are no guarantees that what I do will be rewarded, but I am doing work I believe is needed and necessary, and not doing it is not an option, and never has been for me."

## Process

1. **Draft** — Write the content following the voice profile
2. **Check banned words** — Search for every word/pattern on the banned list
3. **Run anti-slop rules** — All 5 must pass
4. **Read aloud** — Does it sound like Andy talking?
5. **Trim** — Cut 20% on the first edit pass. There's always fat.
